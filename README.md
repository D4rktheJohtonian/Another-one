They haven't been online for 30+ days. I don't know if they're busy with rl stuff or turn off the online status.

I really miss them more than the others somehow. These two are the one I'm very awaited for.

If you're their friend and know their discord, please tell me. (You can chat me through discord or send messages through my ata/straw)

**Fyi**

I like both HeartGoldshipping/HibiRe and Namelessshipping/ReGuri (though not alot).

I don't mind C+H, I even encouraged it. But it's better if you're my friend/you know Pok√©mon/The Mandela Catalogue <3.
